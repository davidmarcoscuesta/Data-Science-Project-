# Response Time in Semantic Memory in a Divergent Thinking Task
Colab with Soran Malaie, Dr. Michael Spivey and Dr. Tyler Marghetis. 

## Project Overview
This project, led by David Marcos Cuesta, investigates the relationship between word frequency and response time in a divergent thinking task. It contributes to ongoing research from Dr. Tyler Marghetis's lab and Dr. Michael Spivey's lab.

## Data Source
The dataset stems from the experiments that have given light to this scientific paper "Divergent and Convergent Creativity Are Different Kinds of Foraging" by Soran Malaie.

## Repository Contents
R Markdown Files: Contains the code for data analysis and visualization.
Data: The master_file_01.csv from the original research and wordFrequency60k.xlsx for word frequency information.
Scripts: Custom scripts for data cleaning and analysis.

## Results
Preliminary analysis indicates no significant correlation between response time and word frequency. However, limitations due to data collection and external variables highlight the need for more controlled future research.

## Contributions and Future Work
This exploratory analysis paves the way for more nuanced studies on semantic memory retrieval. Future directions include examining semantic distances and designing more robust experimental frameworks.
